Task
----

We present you the Dog barbershop. People dress up their dogs and they want them to be beautiful. Your task is to create an information system supporting the dog barbershop. For one, the application should keep record of customers (their name, surname, address, and phone). The customers can bring as many pets as they want. The system should keep track of dogâ€™s name, breed, age and other needed attributes. The barbershop employees are also kept in the system. The employees have the same attributes as the customers with the addition of their salary. The dogs can enjoy different services and the services must be treated as such. The system should keep track of the performed service, its length and price.
